This file will show how to write a configuration file for a test.

1. GPIO Loopback
================================================================================
File name is board name, i.e, S0101.conf, S0361.conf. The first 4 lines are 
header for configuration file, it describes the meaning of each line.

IMPORTANT, PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THE HEADER.

The 5th line has 2 arguments, first one is chipset, it should be PCH or SuperIO,
and the other is base address. Base address could be 0, 500 or 1C00, 0 for 
SuperIO, 500 and 1C00 for PCH. 500 is GPIO base address for Ivy Bridge and 1C00 
for Sandy Bridge.

The 6th line has 1 arguments, numbers of pin.
The 7th line has N arguments, depends on the number in 6th line, every argument 
seperate with space.

For example, the following content is configuration file for S0101, so the file
name is S0101.conf.

# DON NOT MIDIFY THIS HEADER
# First line: chipset base_address
# Second line: number of pins
# Third line: pin number ..., separate with space
PCH 500

2. Hardware Monitor
================================================================================
File name is chip name(SuperIO or BMC), i.e AST1300.conf, NCT6776F. The first 
three lines are header for the configuration file, it describes the meaning of 
each line.

IMPORTANT, PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THE HEADER.

The 4th line has 2 arguments, first one is chip name, the other is address for 
SuperIO or BMC.

The 5th~ lines has 6 arguments, each argument seperate with comma.

Sensor Name, Pin Number, Parameter 1, Parameter 2, Minimum Value, Maximum Value
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    CPUFAN1,        124,         164,           0,           500,          5000

For example, the following content is configuration file for NCT6776F(SuperIO), 
the file name is NCT6776F.conf.

# DO NOT MODIFY THIS HEADER
# First line: chip_name, address
# Others: sensor_name, pin, par1, par2, min, max
